We look for two kinds of sponsorship - swag, & food. For either of these, please contact chris@gianthatworks.com or message him on Meetup

## Food - How it works

1. You offer to sponsor the food & drink
2. As accurately as we can, we decide how much to order
3. We take care of getting it all there
4. You're added as a sponsor on Meetup/here for that event
5. At the start of ArchRails, you get a 5-10m period to present whatever you'd like - recruiting, pitching, trolling, etc
6. After ArchRails, we'll send you an invoice + receipts

### Pricing


Tl;DR: Expect it to be $200-$300

If you'd like us to take care of it, Jimmy John's is our default choice - this covers a lot of food allergies and is also vegetarian-friendly, and vegan-friendly. But if you'd like to sponsor something else/something special, you're more than welcome and we'll help however we can!

* $28 - 15 Vegan sandwiches
* $84 - 45 Regular sandwiches

For every 7 attendees over 30, we add an extra 15 regular sandwiches for $28

We aim to make sure everyone can get at least two sandwiches (they're 1/3 the size of a regular JJ sandwich), so based on the RSVP ~1 week out, we'll put in the order (and then modify it from there).

All of this reflects our best guess with the information we currently have, and will be updated the more we know.

* $112 + $28 * ( (attendance - 30) / 7)
* + Tax
* + Possible other smaller fees we don't know about
* + $50 for drinks - whatever we're able to recycle from last time.
* + Beer ?? (We will coordinate based on your preferences)

You're welcome to take what you want after ArchRails is over!

## Swag

Swag is anything desirable we can give away for attendance.

### What swag is used for

At the end of every meetup, swag is raffled off to the attendees who RSVP'd on Meetup + showed up. This is to encourage people to actually RSVP so we can make sure everyone gets fed!

### What kind of swag do you look for?

* Coffee Mugs
* Stickers
* T-shirts
* Licenses for programs (IDE's, RubyMotion, Educational Subscriptions)
* Books
* Anything else you'd like to offer.
