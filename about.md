Arch Rails is a meetup for people interested in learning about application development using Ruby on Rails. Anyone is welcome - software developers obviously, but also front-end devs, designers and business people who are interested in seeing what Rails can do and how to work with Rails developers.

### Our Goals

tl;dr - help the STL Rails community become more visibly entrepeneurial

1) Consistent time, date, location

2) Talks that are more interesting that what you could find by staying at home and watching youtube

3) To always have tasty food & drink

4) To have either fun, or desirable swag to raffle off at every one
